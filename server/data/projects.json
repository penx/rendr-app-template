The system consists of a set of light bulbs that can be controlled by a central 'bridge' - the bridge connects to the user's network and allows anyone with a basic knowledge of programming to control various aspects of the bulbs, including brightness, colour and scheduling. \n The documentation I wrote was aimed at Philip's customers who wanted to create custom code, e.g. to integrate the bulbs with other home automation software. \n Several code examples, written in JavaScript, were also written to accompany the documentation, e.g. connecting to Yahoo's Weather API and colouring the bulbs according to the current weather.",

With new content being added several times a week and new microsites being launched every few weeks, the site had to be easy add new pages and very flexible. Microsites were frequent and varied - many included user generated content such as mp3 uploads (allowing undiscovered artists win funding from O2) and image galleries. When I started on the project there were two parts to the site, one set of code in JSP and another in ASP.Net. My tasks involved getting the two sites to work well together, e.g. sharing navigation elements without the need to duplicate code between the two projects. I subsequently led the development of a new version, including an ASP.Net master site and a template ASP.Net solution for microsites that pulled in common elements from the master site.",
