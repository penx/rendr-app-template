## Portfolio site

A fork of the rendr-app-template to power my portfolio site, to be located at www.mcleay.com.

## Requirements

 - Top level pages: Project List (home), About, Code Samples, Availability
 - Project pages: each project to have a name, logo, date, client(s), role, key technologies, description (flagged as either text or html), images, tags (e.g. developer, tech lead), list of URLs. Initially this can be stored in a static file but eventually need something to make quick one-step updates (e.g. automated builds or admin system/database). 
 - Availability: Connect to a public google maps calendar and show availability

## Road map

 - v1 - Basic site with projects and minimal changes from rendr-app-template
 - Future - Admin system or automated builds for adding projects, new design
